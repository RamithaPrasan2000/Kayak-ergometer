# Kayak Ergometer

In the ergometer project, we designed the mechanical system for a kayak ergometer. The base was constructed using wood operations. To implement the mechanism, we used two one-way clutch bearings, ropes, a flywheel, a seat, springs, and pulleys. Additionally, cushions were added to the bottom of the wooden base to maintain balance.
